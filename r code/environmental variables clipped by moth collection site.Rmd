title: "Environmental variables clipped by moth collected sites"
output: github_document

### Aim
using raster & rgdal package function to clip environmental variables information 

the data we needed:  
1. moth collection sites (GPS)  
2. environmental layers  
    - TCCIP  
    - A GIS-based environmental database of Taiwan and Penghu islands

```{r setup_packages}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(raster)
library(rgdal)

```


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
